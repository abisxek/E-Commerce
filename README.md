# **E-Commerce**

## INTRODUCTION

Online shopping or online retailing is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser. An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a bricks-and-mortar retailer or shopping center, the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping.

E-commerce is a fast-growing business solution. Many business organizations are adapting and implementing this new art of business by implementing websites and web solutions providing all the functionalities for choosing and performing commercial transactions over the web. This process is becoming a bigger hit as the days are passing by. Online store is a store on the Internet that has various customers to find out their needed product or service and buy their product of interest. These online shopping applications support the interaction between different parties participating in a commercial transaction via a computer network. People need different things in their day-to-day life. For that reason, they have to go out physically to specific shops and buy their necessary goods there. But problems arise when the products are not available in that shop or region, resulting in waste of time and money. So that is why we tried to develop such a website that allows the end users to browse a shop just from their desktop or laptop and buy and order the placement in his house in an easy navigated process. This project is titled ‘E-commerce Website - Shoppie.com’. The objective of this project is to develop an e-commerce website for cross platform over the Internet.

A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini world or the universe of discourse. Changes to the in world are reflected in the database.  A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database. A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.
